DNN, DSN & Transfer learning DNN, DSN for matlab
================

The toolbox is revised based on [Prediction as a candidate for learning deep hierarchical models of data](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6284)

New features added is deep stack network (DSN) based on:
Parallel Training of Deep Stacking Networks (Deng Li et al.)

Used in the paper:

A Deep Learning method for Classification of images RSVP events with EEG data

Classification of Non-time-locked Rapic Serial Visual Presentation Events for Brain Computer Interface Using Deep Learning

Predicting Serial Visual Presentation Events from EEG Signals Using Deep Learning
